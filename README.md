# 🏆 TrustMesh - Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025

**Computational Trust Network on Hedera**  
*48-hour execution plan for hackathon victory*

---

## ⚡ **60-Second Quickstart**

### **What We're Building**
TrustMesh: The first **bounded dynamical system for computational trust** on Hedera. Make trust programmable without losing its human essence.

### **Our Winning Edge**
- **Academic Foundation**: Princeton computational trust theory
- **Technical Innovation**: 5 HCS standards for social trust networks  
- **Real Economic Value**: TRST staking creates skin-in-the-game
- **Viral Demo**: Campus Welcome Fair scenario that judges will remember

### **Demo Hook**
*"What if trust wasn't just a feeling, but something you could measure, stake, and build community around?"*

## 🎬 **The Winning Demo: "Alex's First Day"** *(5 minutes)*

1. **QR Onboarding** (60s): Alex scans booth QR → creates profile → welcome trust coin
2. **Trust Exchange** (90s): Meets Jordan → gives trust token for "helpful guidance"  
3. **Badge Recognition** (90s): Volunteers at eco booth → earns "Eco Helper" badge
4. **Community Poll** (60s): Votes "Best Dressed" → real-time results + winner badge
5. **Reputation Milestone** (60s): Reaches "Active Member" → unlocks privileges
