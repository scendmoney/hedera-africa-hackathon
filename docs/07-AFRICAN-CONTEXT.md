# üåç African Context - TrustMesh

> **Trust Infrastructure for African Digital Transformation**

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

### **Why Africa Needs TrustMesh**
Africa faces a $2.3 trillion trust gap that blocks economic participation for 400 million adults. Current systems rely on Western credit models that ignore African social capital, kinship networks, and community validation systems. TrustMesh bridges this gap by creating decentralized trust infrastructure that recognizes African social structures while enabling global economic participation.

### **Key African Challenges Addressed**
- **65% Financial Exclusion**: Traditional banking ignores 400M adults without formal credit history
- **Informal Economy Dominance**: 85% of African businesses operate informally with no digital footprint
- **Urban-Rural Digital Divide**: Rural communities lack access to centralized trust systems
- **Youth Unemployment**: 70% of Africa's population under 30 lacks formal employment verification
- **Cross-Border Trade Barriers**: Regional trust verification costs 40% of transaction value
